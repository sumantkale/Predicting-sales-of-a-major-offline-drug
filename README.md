## Project Description

In this project, we aim to predict sales for a major offline drug store. We start by preprocessing the data, removing rows with zero sales, and then proceed with the model selection and training. Multiple regression algorithms, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost, are employed to make accurate sales predictions.

## Data

The dataset used in this project contains information about the drug store, including sales, features, and other relevant variables. The data was preprocessed to handle zero sales entries effectively.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need Python and several libraries. Please refer to the Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts provided in this repository for specific installation requirements.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts to explore the data, train models, and evaluate their performance.

## Models

We used the following machine learning models for sales prediction:

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- AdaBoost Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor

Each model's hyperparameters were tuned to achieve the best possible performance.

## Results

We evaluated model performance using the following metrics:

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Root Mean Squared Percentage Error (RMPSE)
- Coefficient of Determination (R-squared or R2 Score)

Detailed results and insights can be found in the respective Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts.

## Conclusion

Key findings from this project include:
- The impact of removing rows with zero sales on model performance.
- The trade-off between data loss and model accuracy.
- The selection of the XGBoost model as the most accurate predictor.
